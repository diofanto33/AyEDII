    <array_length>
    <array_elem_1> <array_elem_2> <array_elem_3> ... <array_elem_N>

    In other words, the first line must be the array length, and the next line
    must contain 'length' amount of elements separated by one or more

    Those elements are copied into the array 'a'. 
    The array_length must be lower or equal to 'max_size'.

    Returns the length of the array.
